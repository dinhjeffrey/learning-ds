Note the following: 
1. How the confidence intervals using 20 tosses differ from the confidence intervals based on 10 tosses?
The 20 tosses had a lower upper CI than the 10 tosses

2. How the confidence intervals change when you change the confidence level?
Lower CI goes up, Upper CI goes down - when you lower CI
Vice versa

3. How do the P-values change when you change the values of A and B?
When I lower B, the P value goes up. When I increase B, the P value goes down.
Vice versa for A.

4. How do the p-values in trials 1-5 differ from the p-values in trials 6-10?
The P values seem the same.
