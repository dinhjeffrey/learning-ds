#PART 1: Design of Experiments

##1. Controlled Experiments

###Summary
1. Statisticians use the method of comparison. They want to know the effect of a treatment (like the Salk vaccine) on a response (like getting polio). To find out, they compare the responses of a <i>treatment group</i> with a <i>control group</i>. Usually, it is hard to judge the effect of a treatment without comparing it to something else.

2. If the control group is comparable to the treatment group, apart from the treatment, then a difference in the responses of the two groups is likely to be due to the effect of the treatment.

3. However, if the treatment group is different from the control group with respect to other factors, the effects of these other factors are likely to be <i>confounded</i> with the effect of the treatment.

4. To make sure that the treatment group is like the control group, investigators put subjects into treatment or control at random. <i>This is done in randomized controlled experiments.</i>

5. Whenever possible, the control group is given a <i>placebo</i>, which is neutral but resembles the treatment. The response should be to the treatment itself rather than to the idea of treatment.

6. In a <i>double-blind</i> experiemnt, the subjects do not know whether they are in treatment or in control; neither do those who evaluate the responses. This guards against bias, either in the responses or in the evaluations.

##2. Observational Studies

<b>Confounding: </b> means a difference between the treatment and control groups - other than the treatment - which affects the responses being studied. A confounder is a third variable, associated with exposure and with disease.

###Summary
1. In an <i>observational study</i>, the investigators do not assign the subjects to treatment or control Some of the subjects have the condition whose effects are being studied; this is the treatment group. The other subjects are the controls. For example, in a study on smoking, the smokers form the treatment group and the non-smokers are the controls.

2. Observational studies can establish <i>association</i>: one thing is linked to another. Association may point to causation: if esposure causes disease, then people who are exposed should be sicker than similar people who are not exposed. But association does not prove causation. 

3. In an observational study, the effects of treatment may be confounded with effects of factors that got the subjects into treatment or control in the first place. Observational studies can be quite misleading about cause-and-effect relationships, because of confounding. A <i>confounder</i> is a third variable, associated with exposure and with disease.

4. When looking at a study, ask the following questions. Was there any control group at all? Were historical controls used, or contemporaneous controls? How were subjects assigned to treatment - through a process under the control of the investigator(a controlled experiement), or a process outside the control of the investigator(an observational study)? If a controlled experiment, was the assignment made using a chance mechanism(randomized controlled), or did assignment depend on the judgment of the investigator?

5. With observational studies, and with nonrandomized controlled experiments, try to find out how the subjects came to be in treatment or in control Are the groups comparable? different? What factors are confounded with treatment? What adjustments were made to take care of confounding? Were they sensible?

6. In an observational study, a confounding factor can sometimes be <i>controlled for</i>, by comparing smaller groups which are relatively homogeneous with respect to the factor.

7. Study design is a central issue in applied statistics. Chapter 1 introduced the idea of randomized experiements, and chapter 2 draws the contrast with observational studies. The great weakness of observational studies in confounding; randomized experiments minimize this problem. Statistical inference from randomized experiments will be discussed in chapter 27.
