#PART 1: Design of Experiments

##1. Controlled Experiments

###Summary
1. Statisticians use the method of comparison. They want to know the effect of a treatment (like the Salk vaccine) on a response (like getting polio). To find out, they compare the responses of a <i>treatment group</i> with a <i>control group</i>. Usually, it is hard to judge the effect of a treatment without comparing it to something else.

2. If the control group is comparable to the treatment group, apart from the treatment, then a difference in the responses of the two groups is likely to be due to the effect of the treatment.

3. However, if the treatment group is different from the control group with respect to other factors, the effects of these other factors are likely to be <i>confounded</i> with the effect of the treatment.

4. To make sure that the treatment group is like the control group, investigators put subjects into treatment or control at random. <i>This is done in randomized controlled experiments.</i>

5. Whenever possible, the control group is given a <i>placebo</i>, which is neutral but resembles the treatment. The response should be to the treatment itself rather than to the idea of treatment.

6. In a <i>double-blind</i> experiemnt, the subjects do not know whether they are in treatment or in control; neither do those who evaluate the responses. This guards against bias, either in the responses or in the evaluations.
